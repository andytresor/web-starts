    <p>     The particuliarity about my YouTube landing page is that once you click on an icon, it will display details about the image like the Artist name, number of views, the date the videos was released and a comment bar for you to enter your comments on the same page and then the videos will be played by the side on the very page</p>
    <p>The page also permits you to view lattest infos since YouTube is one off the most visited sites, it will help bring awareness to does who don't have time to listen to news on.</p>
